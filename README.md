# BKEQCYCLE
This is a matlab code to solve for the Burridge-Knopoff (BK) model. 
The BK model is a system of differential equations used to model earthquakes. The given code uses two sliders:
1) rate weakening slider
2) rate strengthning slider

The problem being solved is to find out how the coupled system of a locked and creeping segments of a fault behave when the system is 
being perturbed by external forcing at a given time ( e.g. a passing dynamic earthquake wave).
